Graphviz build notes 11 February 2011

The build process is stored in the graphviz-build  CVS repository (here).

The starting point for all builds is really the crontab on gviz@penguin
which is mastered at graphviz-build/etc/penguin.research.att.com.crontab

Leopard builds are done on gviz@snares
Snowleopard builds are done on gviz@stayman

The mac builds don't depend on MacPorts, so periodically the dependencies
have to be manually prebuilt using
macos/prebuild/Makefile.leopard
macos/prebuild/Makefile.snowleopard
in the main tree. 

The configure options are stored in these files. See
/Users/gviz/FIX/Darwin.i386/build/graphviz2/macosx/prebuild/some-package

The prebuilt dependencies are saved in /Users/gviz/FIX/Darwin.i386/

The mac builds are mult-arch binaries: i686, x86_64, ppc
